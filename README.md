### Hi there 👋

- 👨🏻‍💻 In case you're interested, I'm a programmer, data scientist, and web designer.
- 🎓 Checkout my publications on educational data analysis [here](https://base.ustc.edu.cn).
- 🎨 A few things I also enjoy learning: programming language theory, music theory, and design theory (yeah very theoretical).
- 📘 I'm currently working on a book about better programming with Rust.
- 🎸 I also love playing guitar and bass in my free time.
